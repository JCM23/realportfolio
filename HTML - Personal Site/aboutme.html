    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      I am a 22 years old Computer Science student at the University of Regina.
      I am a motivated individual who is adaptable in any fields. I chose
      Computer Science as my major because being a web developer has been my
      dream ever since I started high-school.
    </p>
    <p>
      I believe that I am capable of learning many important components when it
      comes to being a web developer. Im also willing to improve my programming
      skill set throughout the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also bring positive energy in any workplace I encounter or experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      My goal in life is to simply achieve financial freedom while doing the
      things I love and being able to provide to my loved ones. I really just
      really wanna enjoy life as much as possible and lived fully in this
      universe.
